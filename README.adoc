= Mesa X

Mesa X is a project by https://github.com/dpp[dpp]
to see if we can think about spreadsheets differently.

dpp wrote a bit about other ways to think
about https://blog.goodstuff.im/spreadsheet_thinking_2019[spreadsheets].

This project is exploratory... it's dpp's exploration
of different spreadsheet approaches... and an exploration
of coding in https://rust-lang.org[Rust].

For design thinking, etc. please check out the
`/info` directory or the upcoming
https://mesa-x.org[blog].

The project is licensed under an Apache 2.0 license. If
there are cool things to be done with spreadsheets, let's
make them universally available.

Pull requests welcome.
